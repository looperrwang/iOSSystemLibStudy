#  Viewing Pipeline Statistics of a Draw

> See relative percentages of where a given draw call spent its time across the GPU architecture.

查看给定绘制调用在 GPU 架构中花费时间的相对百分比。

## Overview

> View pipeline statistics to understand which GPU activities your draw call is performing the most. When the GPU is in one state for a relatively long time, it can indicate a performance bottleneck that you should consider optimizing.

查看管道统计信息以了解你的绘制调用执行最多的 GPU 活动。当 GPU 相当长的时间处于一种状态时，即指示了一个你应该考虑优化的性能瓶颈。
